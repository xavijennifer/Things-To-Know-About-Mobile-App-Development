**WHAT DOES MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT MEAN?**

The process of developing mobile apps on a mobile device is known as mobile app development. The uses of mobile apps are increasing day by day. We can download these applications from the Google play store or the app store which is available from the mobile itself. Henceforth, this portable device's development measures include making installable programming groups (code, binaries, assets, and so on), carrying out backend administrations, for example, information access with a Programming interface, and testing the application on track devices. Application programming designers additionally should think about a long exhibit of screen sizes, equipment details, and setups in light of exceptional rivalry in versatile programming and changes inside every one of the stages.

[Mobile app development](https://wethinksolution.com/) mainly has two stages or platforms. They're the iOS (iPhone Operating System) platform from Apple Inc and Android from Google. The first one is the system operator which controls all of Apple's mobile devices. The other one is utilized by Google gadgets as well as by numerous other OEMs to manufactured their own smart devices. In spite of the fact that there are a few likenesses between these two stages when developing apps, the creation of both these platforms includes utilizing distinctive programming development packs and diverse advancement toolchains. But in the case of Apple, they utilize iOS only for its own gadgets and in the case of the performance of Android from Google, it is accessible to different organizations and they use Google apps in their devices. By focusing on both of these stages, it is possible by a developer to construct a huge no. of applications for any device.


**STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS OF MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT**

These days mobile app users have a steady increase in the mobile industry. Also, most of the businesses became a digitalized businesses. So, it is essential to know how a mobile app is developed? An effective mobile app is developed mainly through 6 stages.

1.	**Strategy** : Before developing the mobile apps, the first thing you have to do that, to define the strategy which leads your thought into a fruitful application. You may remember a more huge piece of this for your general undertaking mobility system. As one application's goals may vary from another, there is as yet an application explicit effect on the portability system to address during the advancement cycle.
This stage is mainly concerned with the following things:
•	Recognize the application clients
•	Exploration the opposition
•	Build up the application's objectives and destinations
•	Choose a mobile platform for your application

2. **Analysis and Planning** : This phase starts with characterizing use cases and catching point-by-point utilitarian prerequisites. Next thing after distinguished the necessities for your application, set up an item guide. This incorporates focusing on the mobile app prerequisites and gathering them into conveyance achievements. If there is any problem with the availability of time, resources, or expenses, you should characterize your base feasible item and focus on this for the underlying dispatch. Moreover, in this stage, you should choose a unique name for your app.

3. **UI / UX Design** : The main aim of a mobile app is have to a great client experience and thus the app will become more interactive, innate, and easy to use. This design will assist with early selection, your application should have natural client encounters to keep application clients' locked in.
 
4. **App Development** : Before developing app, you should have to determine the technical framework, pick an innovation stack, and to characterize the growth achievements. Back-end/server technology, API(s), and the mobile application front-end are the major necessary parts of a mobile app development.

5. **Testing** : There are many types of testing like User Experience Testing, Functional Testing, Performance Testing, Security Testing, and finally Device and Platform Testing. Testing is basic to an application's future achievement; it includes a considerable part of our general mobile application improvement project. While developing mobile apps, you should have to go through these testing techniques for conveying a quality portable application.
 
6. **Deployment & Support** : The final step is to launch your mobile app in any app stores like Apple App Store or Google Play stores. So for that you should have a developer account in these app stoers. Usually Apple app stores is used for iOS apps and the other one is for Android apps. You should also have to consider an apt name for your application, a good description and also launcu icon of your app.
After your application opens up in the application stores, you can estimate your application's prosperity via Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and screen its use through mobile analytical stages . Often check crash reports, or other client detailed issues. You should also want to give an open space to your users by collecting feedbacks and suggetions on time.
